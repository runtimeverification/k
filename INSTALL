# Overview

The K Framework tool has been tested and is known to work on Linux (either
32-bits or 64-bits) and on Mac OSX.

The installation of K Framework consists of three steps: installing the 
dependencies, downloading the `k-framework` directory, and finally configuring 
and testing K.

Instructions on writing, compiling, and executing K definitions can be found in
the `README` file.

The K Framework tool depends on the following software:

* *[Maude](http://maude.cs.uiuc.edu)* The K Framework uses the Maude rewrite
  system as a backend for execution, exploring executions, and model checking.
* *GNU Make* The example K definitions use GNU Makefiles for compilation.
* *Perl* The compilation scripts are written in Perl. In addition, the K
  framework depends on the following Perl modules:
    * Regexp::Common
    * XML::DOM
    * XML::LibXML::Reader
    * Tree::Nary
    * Text::Diff
* *LaTeX* (optional) This is used for typesetting K definitions. Besides basic
  packages, the following (texlive) packages are needed: bera, datetime, ec,
  fancybox, fancyvrb, import, marginnote, microtype, ms, pdfcomment, pgf,
  preview, stmaryrd, times, titlesec, ucs, url, xcolor, and xkeyval.

# Installation instructions

## Install Maude

First, obtain Core Maude from <http://maude.cs.uiuc.edu/download>. Perform any
installation instructions included with Maude. Then,

* add the `maude` directory to your system's `PATH`,
* set the `MAUDE_LIB` environment variable to the `maude` directory,
* and rename the appropriate executable to `maude`, or create a symlink.

To test the installation of Maude, run:

    $ echo "" | maude

If everything went fine, you should see something like 

    $ echo "" | maude
             \||||||||||||||||||/
           --- Welcome to Maude ---
             /||||||||||||||||||\
        Maude 2.6 built: Dec 10 2010 11:12:39

without any additional *Warning* or *Error* messages.

## Install GNU Make and Perl Dependencies

This step varies from distribution to distribution. Here are
distro-specific instructions for a couple of popular distributions.

### Debian/Ubuntu

First, install the build-essential package which includes gcc, make, 
and other packages needed to build and compile software:

    # apt-get install build-essential

Next, install some of the K Framework's Perl dependencies:

    # apt-get install libregexp-common-perl libxml-libxml-perl libxml-dom-perl libtext-diff-perl

Unfortunately, Debian does not include a package for the Tree::Nary Perl
module, so it must be installed manually:

    # cpan -i Tree::Nary

Now you're ready to jump to the section on downloading K.

### Mac OSX

First install XCode from <http://developer.apple.com/xcode>.  
This will provide you with a minimal building environment, 
including perl, gcc, make, and svn.  

Then follow the instructions below for installing Perl dependencies.

### Other

Use your distribution's package manager to install GNU Make and Perl.

On most distributions, the following command will install all the needed
Perl dependencies:

    # cpan -i Regexp::Common XML::DOM XML::LibXML::Reader Tree::Nary Text::Diff
	
Sometimes this needs to be done as root.

Once GNU Make, Perl, and the Perl modules are installed, jump to the
section on downloading K.


## Download the K Framework

The K Framework can be installed from SVN or from nightly release snapshots.
The nightly release snapshots are about a day behind the SVN repository and
don't contain SVN information, but they do contain pre-compiled PDFs and K
definitions.

To install K from the nightly release snapshots, go to:

<http://code.google.com/p/k-framework/downloads>

and download `k-framework-nightly.tar.gz`. Extract it as follows:

    $ tar zxvf k-framework-nightly.tar.gz

To download K from SVN, use the following command:

    $ svn checkout https://k-framework.googlecode.com/svn/tags/latest/ k-framework

Both approaches will leave you with a new directory called `k-framework` in
your current directory.


## Install the K Framework

To complete the installation of the K Framework, set the `K_BASE` environment 
variable to the absolute path of the `k-framework` directory;  
you might also want to add `k-framework/core` and `k-framework/tools` 
directories to your system's `PATH` variable if you plan on calling kompile 
directly (without using the `make` tool).

### Linux/OSX/UNIX/etc

On most operating systems, the following command will set `K_BASE`
(be sure to replace <somedir> with the directory that contains 
the k-framework directory):

    $ export K_BASE=<somedir>/k-framework

To make this change persistent across logins/shells, you will need to add
the command to a file like `~/.profile` or `~/.bashrc`.

## Test your installation

Once the necessary dependencies are installed and the necessary paths are set,
you should be able to type `make` in the `k-framework/tests/regression`
directory and have all of the test cases pass.


## Test the K LaTeX backend

If the above step succeeded, K can already generate LaTeX code for definitions.
Executing

    $ make latex

in one of the examples directories, e.g., 

    examples/languages/research/simple/untyped

should produce a file `simple-untyped.tex` containing the LaTeX code 
corresponding to the definition.

Assuming a sufficiently recent distribution of LaTeX with all the packages
mentioned in prerequisites is installed, one can compile K definitions into
good-looking PDFs which are nicer to read than their ASCII counterparts.

To test whether the generation of PDFs works, either use `pdflatex` to compile
the `.tex` file obtained above, or execute

    $ make pdf

in the `examples/languages/research/simple/untyped` directory.

This should generate a PDF of the `SIMPLE-UNTYPED` definition which is a good
starting point for understanding more about K definitions and the process of
developing and testing them.

# Problems / Questions

If you experience any problems installing K, please do not hesitate to contact
the development team at <k-user@cs.uiuc.edu>.  Also, please let us know about 
installation steps you had to perform that we did not mention.
