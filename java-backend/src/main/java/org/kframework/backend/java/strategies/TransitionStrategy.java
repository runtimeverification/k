/**
 * The TransitionStrategy partitions the rules into transitional rules and
 * structural rules. It is instantiated with a list of transition strings,
 * and upon receiving a new collection of rules, it pulls out any rules
 * tagged with one or more of these transition strings. When iterating over
 * the rule classes, the structural rules are returned first, followed by
 * the transition rules. The idea is that during execution we only want to
 * apply transition rules when there are no more structural rules to be applied.
 *
 * This class also provides a function saying whether the next equivalence
 * class is the transition class. This is used during search in the java
 * rewrite engine, since transition rules are handled differently than
 * structural rules.
