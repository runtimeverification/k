# K Tutorial

K is a framework which allows you to define a language formally and extract
a set of tools (e.g., interpreter, parser, symbolic verifier) for it 
automatically.

In this series of lessons you will learn how to program in K. 
Since the tutorial is addressed mainly to developers, 
we assume you have a firm grounding in computer science broadly, as 
well as experience writing code in functional programming languages.

For a more detailed tutorial explaining the basic principles of programming
language design, refer to 
[K PL Tutorial](https://www.github.com/runtimeverification/pl-tutorial).
Keep in mind that it might be out of date.

To start the K tutorial, begin with
[Section 1: Basic Programming in K](1_basic/README.md).
