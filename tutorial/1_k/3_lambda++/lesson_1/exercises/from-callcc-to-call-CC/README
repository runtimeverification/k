Define callCC in terms of callcc, where callCC is explained in the
callCC exercise under LAMBDA++, Lesson 1.  Follow a substitution-based style.

To facilitate testing, call the main module CALLCC (see tests/config.xml).
For example, you can define a module CALLCC which imports the previous
definition of callcc and adds the definition of callCC in terms of callcc.
