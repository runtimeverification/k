# features:
# limit the length of lines you keep the same way you limit the number of lines
# ordering of cells in output (e.g., move k to end, move env to beginning)
# color the cell name only, not the brackets
# ability to color the brackets < > differently
# give colors to a pattern, (e.g., look for "('promote).KProperLabel" and color the promote red) (looks like this is in your todo)
# replace "('foo).K.*?Label( properly nested contents )" with "foo( properly nested contents )"
# replace "('_foo_).K.*?Label(first,, second)" with "first foo first"
# conditional show and hide, (e.g., if "foo" is the top element of < k >, then show the < bar > cell, otherwise don't)
# split contents of a cell based on something
# match lines/characters from a string based on numbers in other cells (i know what line i

# Default behavior is to blacklist everything else. Note that neither whitelisting or blacklisting are
# recursive, e.g. blacklisting <thread> wont blacklist all of its children

# Current features:
#   whitelisting
#   keep only a certain number of lines
#   recursive hide


# Upcoming features:
#   colors
#   environment/memory lookup
#   regular-expression based line-based show/hide
#   arbitrary global and local string-replacement rules
#   local and global regular-expression based styling (bold, underline, color, etc)
