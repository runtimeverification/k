// Normally, one would think that the program below has only two behaviors.
// However, it has four, due to the race on the output buffer.

function main() {
  spawn {
    var x = 2;
    print(x," ");
  };
  spawn {
    var x = 3;
    print(x," ");
  };
}

// 4 solutions, namely all interleavings of "2_" and "3_", where "_" is space
