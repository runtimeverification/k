K Tutorial --- LAMBDA --- Substitution
by Grigore Rosu

We here learn how to include a predefined module, SUBSTITUTION, and how to
use it to define the characteristic semantic rule of lambda calculus.

The "requires" keyword takes a .k file containing language features that are
needed for the current definitions.  The predefined features are referred to
using their relative path from the k/include folder.  Thus, the command

  require "modules/substitution.k"

says that the subsequent definition of LAMBDA needs the generic substitution,
which is predefined in file modules/substitution.k under the folder k/include.

Import in LAMBDA (using the "imports" keyword) the module SUBSTITUTION, which
is defined in the required substitution.k file.

Now we have all the substitution machinery available for our definition.
However, since our substitution is generic, it cannot know which language
constructs bind variables; this information is critical in order to correctly
solve the variable capture problem.  Thus, you have to tell the substitution
that your lambda construct is meant to be a binder.  This is simply done
using the attribute "binder".

Now we are ready to give the beta-reduction rule of lambda calculus, making
use of substitution in its right-hand side, as shown in lambda.k.

Compile the definition and then run some programs.

First, you will notice that a new cell has been added to the configuration.
For example,

  krun variable_capture.lambda

yields the output

 <k>
  lambda _id0 . ((lambda x . (lambda y . (x  y)))  _id0) 
 </k> 
 <nextId>
  1 
 </nextId> 

The new cell <nextId> ... </nextId> has been added by the substitution,
to keep track of the fresh variables that it needs to generate in order to
avoid variable capture.  In our example above, it has already used a fresh
identifier, _id0, and thus the counter has been incremented (from 0 to 1).

Second, you will notice that only certain programs reduce (some even yield
non-termination, such as omega.lambda), while others do not.  This is because
the K rewrite rules between syntactic terms do not apply anywhere they match.
They only apply where they have been given permission to apply by means of
appropriate evaluation strategies of language constructs, which is done using
strictness attributes, evaluation contexts, heating/cooling rules, etc., as
discussed in the next lessons.

The next lesson will show how to add LAMBDA the desired evaluation strategies.
