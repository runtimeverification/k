\section{Abstract}
This is the \K dynamic semantics of the typed KOOL language.
It is very similar to the semantics of the untyped KOOL, the
difference being that we now check the typing policy dynamically.
Like in the semantics of untyped KOOL, where we borrowed almost all
the semantics of untyped SIMPLE, we are going to also borrow much of
the semantics of dynamically typed SIMPLE here.  We will
highlight the differences between the dynamically typed and the
untyped KOOL as we proceed with the semantics.
