1. This is a readme file for the developers.

2. Install
Checkout this directory in your desired location and update your $PATH to
/dist/bin.  Then build the .jar binaries by calling ant on $K_BASE.

3. Work on Java code
Open eclipse with the spoofax plug-in installed and set your workspace
to /javasources.  Go to File->Import->General->Existing projects into
workspace, and select all of the projects from /javasources.  You can
run the K3Java project to test the main functionalities directly from
eclipse (main project is K3Java), or you can (re)build the .jar binaries
by calling ant on /javasources/K3Java/buld.xml

4. Work on Maude code
Modify the Maude files found in /dist/bin/maude.

5. Build the final release zip
Call 'ant release' in the base directory.  Or you can just zip the
/dist folder after you have built the /javasources.

6. Compiling definitions and running programs
assuming  /dist/bin is in your path, you can compile definitions using
the 'kompile' command.  Until jKrun is released, to execute a  program
you can use the Haskell krun specifying it should use the kast from
/dist/bin as a parser.  Assuming $K3_BASE points to the /dist directory,
the following command should suffice:
krun --parser="$K3_BASE/bin/kast" <program>
