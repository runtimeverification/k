K Tutorial --- LAMBDA --- Syntax
by Grigore Rosu

Here we define our first K module, which contains the initial syntax of LAMBDA.

The keyword "syntax" adds new productions to the syntax grammar, using a
BNF-like notation.

Terminals are enclosed in double-quotes, like strings.

You can define multiple productions for the same non-terminal in the same
syntax declaration using the "|" separator.

Productions can have attributes, which are enclosed in square brackets.

The attribute "left" tells the parser that we want the lambda application to be
left associative.  For example, "a b c d" will then parse as "(((a b) c) d)".

The attribute "bracket" tells the parser to not generate a node for the
parenthesis production in the abstract syntax trees associated to programs.
In other words, we want to allow parentheses to be used for grouping, but we
do not want to bother to give them their obvious (ignore) semantics.

We here define a variant of lambda calculus where identifiers and lambda
abstractions are meant to be irreducible, that is, are meant to be values.
However, so far "Val" is just another non-terminal, just like "Exp",
without any semantic meaning.  It will get a semantic meaning later.

After you are done with typing your definition in the file lambda.k, kompile it
in the current folder with the command:

  kompile lambda.k

If you get no errors then a parser has been generated by the K tool.  This
parser will be called from now on by default by the krun tool.  To see whether
and how the parser works, write some LAMBDA programs and store them in files
with the extension .lambda, or use the predefined ones in ../../programs.
For example:

  krun ../../programs/p3.lambda

Make sure you call the krun command from the folder containing your language
definition (otherwise type "krun --help" to learn how to pass a language
definition as a parameter to kast).  The file p3.lambda contains the LAMBDA
program "(lambda z.(z z)) (lambda x.lambda y.(x y))" ---known for being the
smallest closed lambda expression binding only distinct variables and still
requiring a substitution that avoids variable capture.  The krun command
should then produce the output:

<k>
  (lambda z . (z  z))  (lambda x . (lambda y . (x  y))) 
</k>

If you see such an output it means that your program has been parsed (and then
pretty printed) correctly.  If you want to see the internal abstract syntax
tree (AST) representation of the parsed program, which we call the K AST, then
type the kast command instead of krun:

  krun ../../programs/p3.lambda

Note that the program has been placed in a <k> ... </k> cell.  In K everything
happens in cells.  If you do not define a configuration in your definition,
then a configuration will be created automatically for you which contains only
one cell, called k.

Parse several programs to get a feel for how the parser works.  Parse also
some incorrect programs, to see how the parser generates error messages.
For example, the predefined programs p1.lambda, p2.lambda, p3.lambda should
all parse, but the others should not parse yet (we need to add more features
to the language).

In the next lesson we will see how to define semantic rules that iteratively
rewrite expressions over the defined syntax until they evaluate to a result.
This way, we obtain our first programming language defined using K.
