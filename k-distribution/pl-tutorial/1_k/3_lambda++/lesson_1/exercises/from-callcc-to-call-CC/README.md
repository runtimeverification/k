Define `callCC` in terms of `callcc`, where `callCC` is explained in the
`callCC` exercise under LAMBDA++, Lesson 1.  Follow a substitution-based style.

To facilitate testing, call the main module CALLCC (see tests/config.xml).
For example, you can define a module CALLCC which imports the previous
definition of `callcc` and adds the definition of `callCC` in terms of
`callcc`.
