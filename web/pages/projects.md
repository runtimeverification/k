- **[Dedukti (Mar 2021 - Present)](https://gitlab.com/semantiko/K-semantics)**

  This project aims to translate real K semantics into Dedukti.

- **[KWasm (Aug 2015 - Present)](https://github.com/kframework/wasm-semantics)**

  KWasm is the K semantics of [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.github.io/spec/).
  WebAssembly is a low-level (but simple and streamlined) assembly language that was originally developed to provide a fast execution engine for browser-based tools.
  More recently, it has been used in several blockchain smart-contract platforms as the underlying language for executing financial agreements.
  KWasm has been used for measuring coverage of test-suites over Wasm code and verifying programs which are compiled to Wasm.

- **[KEVM (Sep 2017 - Present)](https://jellopaper.org/)**

  KEVM is the K semantics of the [Ethereum Virtual Machine](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/).
  It passes all of the Ethereum Test Suite, and is used for verifying EVM programs.

- **[IELE (Oct 2016 - Present)](https://ielelang.org/)**

  IELE is the underlying VM integrated into the [Cardano](https://cardano.org/) blockchain.
  IELE is a register-based VM (inspired by LLVM), which attempts to avoid many of the missteps in design present in EVM.

- **[K-Michelson (Oct 2019 - Present)](https://runtimeverification.github.io/michelson-semantics)**

  K-Michelson is the K semantics of [Michelson blockchain programming language](https://www.michelson.org/), which powers the [Tezos blockchain](https://tezos.com/).
  KMichelson provides additional testing tools for developers, including a unit-testing framework which is extendable to symbolic property testing.

- **[C (Jul 2010 - Present)](https://github.com/kframework/c-semantics)**

  The K semantics of the [C programming language](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)>) specifies the translation, linking, and execution semantics of the C language according to the official C standard.
  It has been used to build tools like RV-Match, which detects undefined behaviors in users programs by running their test-suites through the C semantics.
