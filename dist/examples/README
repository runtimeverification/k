We encourage any user of K to contribute with examples to our distribution.
If you have any interesting K definition that you believe is worth showing
to all people who download K, be it a language definition or an algorithm
implemented in an elegant or interesting way thanks to K's capabilities,
please do not hesitate to contact us at info@k-framework.org.

In order for a K definition to be included in the distribution, for
uniformity we strongly recommend that certain conventions be respected:

1) Use sections, subsections, etc., in comments in your definition, because
these turn into bookmarks in many PDF viewers, thus allowing users to browse
your definition more easily.

2) Do not exceed 80 characters per line.  Even though most editors are able
to smoothly deal with long lines, some editors are not.  Moreover, some
people look at definitions by browsing the svn repository with a browser,
or by using a web interface; long lines look bad in these.

3) Add as many comments as possible into your definition.  Feel free to
refer to other existing definitions if you do not want to re-explain
language features which have already been explained by others.  In particular,
there are several basic languages defined and thoroughly commented in the
K tutorial.

Please refrain from adding K definitions in this directory for the sole
purpose of explaining or highlighting K features.  Those are welcome, too,
but they should go into the K tutorial folder, not here.  Please contact us
if you are not sure where your K definition should go.
