1. Prerequisites
Java Runtime Edition (tested with JRE6 or higher)
  http://java.com/en/download/index.jsp
To make sure java is installed properly, call "java" in a terminal.

2. Install
Unzip this directory in your preferred location.  For convenient usage,
update pour $PATH with <preferred-location>/k/bin.

3. Test
Go to one of the examples (let's say k/examples/imp).  Assuming k/bin is in
your $PATH, you can compile definitions using the 'kompile imp.k' command.
To execute a program you can use 'krun programs/sum.imp'.
