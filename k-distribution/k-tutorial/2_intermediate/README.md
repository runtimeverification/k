# Section 2: Intermediate K Concepts

The goal of this second section is to supplement a beginning developer's
knowledge of K after they have gained a basic understanding of K. Each lesson
in this section can be completed independently in order to learn about a
particular facet of the K language. The lessons are written to provide basic
understanding of less commonly-used features of K to someone who is still
learning K. For more complete references of these features, the reader ought to
consult the [User Manual](../../../USER_MANUAL.md).

The reader ought to be able to complete lessons in this section as needed in
order to learn about specific features of interest, but if desired, can also
complete the entire section in one go. Someone who has completed this entire
section ought to be able to read and understand most K specifications, as well
as write their own specifications of some complexity, and use them to perform
most common K-related tasks. They can then read about specific lessons in
[Section 3: Advanced K Concepts](../3_advanced/README.md) if they want to
learn more.
