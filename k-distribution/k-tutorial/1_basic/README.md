# Section 1: Basic K Concepts

The goal of this first section of the K tutorial is to teach the basic
principles of K to someone with no prior experience with K as a programming
language. However, this is not written with the intended audience of someone
who is a complete beginner to programming. We are assuming that the reader
has a firm grounding in computer science broadly, as well as that they have
experience writing code in functional programming languages before.

By the end of this section, the reader ought to be able to write specifications
of simple languages in K, use these specifications to generate a fast
interpreter for their programming language, as well as write basic deductive
program verification proofs over programs in their language. This should give
them the theoretical grounding they need to begin expanding their knowledge
of K in [Section 2: Intermediate K Concepts](../2_intermediate/README.md).

To begin this section, refer to
[Lesson 1.1: Setting up a K Environment](01_installing/README.md).
