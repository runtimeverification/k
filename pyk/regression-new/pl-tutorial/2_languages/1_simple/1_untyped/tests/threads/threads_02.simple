// Simple multithreaded program with two output behaviors
// but with three overall behaviors

function main() {
  var x;
  spawn { x = 7; };
  x = 5;
  print(x,"\n");
}

// 5
// 5 (yes, it admits two behaviors where the output is 5, one in which the 
//    store ends up with value 5 and another with value 7 at the location of x)
// 7
