This currently does NOT work, because of the rules

  rule _:Int => int                            [anywhere]
  rule _:Bool => bool                          [anywhere]

which now rewrite ANY integer ANYWHERE to "int", including integers
that appear in the internal data-structures/functions of the builtins
or Maude.  We will need to allow a strategy where "anywhere" means
anywhere in one or more computational cells.
