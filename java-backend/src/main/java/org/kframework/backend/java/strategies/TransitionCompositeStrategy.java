/**
 * This is a derivation of the CompositeStrategy that always maintains a
 * TransitionStrategy as the top of the stack. It also provides access to
 * the nextIsTransition() method to check whether the next rules to be
 * returned will be transitions or not. This class will be used by the
 * rewrite engine to ensure that structural rules will always be applied
 * before transition rules, while still adding the user to specify more
 * strategies to be used.
 *
 * The actual logic of resetting and getting rules is inherited from
 * CompositeStrategy. All that needs to be changed is pop, and push.
