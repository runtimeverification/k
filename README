1. This is a readme file for the developers.

2. Prerequisites

2.1 Java Develpment Kit (tested with JDK6 or higher)
You can follow the instructions here: 
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/webnotes/install/index.html depending on 
the type of your machine.

To make sure that everything works you should be able to call 'java' and
'javac' from a Terminal.

2.2 Apache ANT
Linux and Mac:
    Most likely you will already have it.
Windows:
    Go to http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi and download the zip with the 
    binary distribution. Unzip it in your desired location and follow the 
    instalation instructions from the 'INSTALL' file.

You can test if it works by calling 'ant' in a Terminal.

2.3 Maude
Linux and Mac:
   Download the binary distribution from http://maude.cs.uiuc.edu/download/, 
   unzip it, and update your $PATH with '<extraction-dir>'. Rename 
   'maude.linux' or 'maude.linux64' to 'maude' (depending on your machine) and
   you should be good to go.
Windows:
    Go to http://moment.dsic.upv.es/ and download Maude for Windows. Follow
    the instructions from the instalation wizard.

To test if maude has been corectly installed, type 'maude' in a Terminal. You
should not get any errors or warnings.

3. Install
Checkout this directory in your desired location and call 'ant' from the main
directory to build the .jar binaries. For convenient usage, you can update
your $PATH with <checkout-dir>/dist/bin (strongly recommended, but optional).

4. Work on Java code
Open eclipse and set your workspace to /javasources.  Go to 
File->Import->General->Existing projects into workspace, and select all of 
the projects from /javasources.  
If you have the spoofax plugin installed in eclipse, you might be able to 
work and compile directly within eclipse (the main project is K3Java and 
can be used to test the main functionalities).

If your do not have the Spoofax plugin, you can still use Eclipse as an editor
and to test functionality not related to parsing.  

If you only modified java files, you can speed up the rebuilding of the
distributed jar:
    ant java jar


5. Work on Maude code
Modify the Maude files found in /dist/bin/maude. No need for recompilation.

6. Build the final release zip
Call 'ant release' in the base directory.  Or you can just zip the
/dist folder after you have built the entire project.

7. Compiling definitions and running programs
assuming  /dist/bin is in your path, you can compile definitions using
the 'kompile' command.  To execute a  program
you can use 'krun'.
