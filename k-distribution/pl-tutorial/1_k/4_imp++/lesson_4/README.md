# Semantic Lists; Input/Output Streaming

In this lesson we add semantics to the `read` and `print` IMP++ constructs.
In doing so, we also learn how to use semantic lists and how to connect
cells holding semantic lists to the standard input and standard output.
This allows us to turn the K semantics into an interactive interpreter.

We start by adding two new cells to the configuration,

    <in color="magenta"> .List </in>
    <out color="Orchid"> .List </out>

each holding a semantic list, initially empty. Semantic lists are
space-separated sequences of items, each item being a term of the form
`ListItem(t)`, where `t` is a term of sort `K`. Recall that the semantic maps,
which we use for states, environments, stores, etc., are sets of pairs
`t1 |-> t2`, where `t1` and `t2` are terms of sort K. The `ListItem` wrapper
is currently needed, to avoid parsing ambiguities.

Since we want the `print` statement to also print strings, we need to tell
K that strings are results. To make it more interesting, let us also overload
the `+` symbol on arithmetic expressions to also take strings and, as a
result, to concatenate them. Since `+` is already strict, we only need to add
a rule reducing the IMP addition of strings to the builtin operation `+String`
which concatenates two strings.

The semantics of `read` is immediate: read and consumes the first integer item
from the `<in/>` cell; note that our read only reads integer values (it gets
stuck if the first item in the `<in/>` cell is not an integer).

The semantics of `print` is a bit trickier. Recall that `print` takes an
arbitrary number of arithmetic expression arguments, and evaluates and outputs
each of them in order, from left to right. For example,
`print("Hello", 3/0, "Bye");` outputs "Hello" and then gets stuck on the
illegal division by zero operation. In other words, we do not want it to
first evaluate all its arguments and then print them, because that would miss
outputting potentially valuable information. So the first step is to evaluate
the first argument of `print`. In some sense, what we'd like to say is that
`print` has the evaluation strategy `strict(1)`. However, strictness
attributes only work with individual language constructs, while what we need
is an evaluation strategy that involves _two_ constructs: `print` and the list
(comma) construct of `AExps`. If we naively associate `print` the `strict(1)`
evaluation strategy then its first and unique argument, an `AExps` list, will
be scheduled for evaluation and the execution will get stuck because we have
no rules for evaluating `AExps` terms. If we make the list construct of
`AExps` `strict` then we get the wrong semantics for `print` which first
evaluates all its arguments and then outputs them. The correct way to
tell K that `print` should evaluate only its first argument is by using a
context declaration:

    context print(HOLE:AExp, _);

Note the `HOLE` of sort `AExp` above. Contexts allow us to define finer-grain
evaluation strategies than the strictness attributes, involving potentially
more than one language construct, like above. The `HOLE` indicates the
argument which is requested to be evaluated. For example, the `strict`
attribute of division corresponds to two contexts:

    context HOLE / _
    context _ / HOLE

In their full generality, contexts can be any terms with precisely one
occurrence of a `HOLE`, and with arbitrary side conditions on any variables
occurring in the context term as well as on the `HOLE`. See Part 6 of the
tutorial for more examples.

Once evaluated, the first argument of `print` is expected to become either an
integer or a string. Since we want to print both integers and string values,
to avoid writing two rules, one for each type of value, we instead add a new
syntactic category, `Printable`, which is the union of integers and strings.

Let us `kompile` and `krun` the `io.imp` program discussed in Lesson 1. As
expected, it gets stuck with a read construct on top of the computation and
with an empty `<in/>` cell. To run it, we need to provide some items in the
`<in/>` cell, so that the rule of read can match. Let us add

    <in> ListItem(3) ListItem(5) ListItem(7) </in>

Now, if we `krun` `io.imp`, we can see that its execution completes normally
(the `<k/>` cell is empty), that the first two items have been removed by the
two read constructs from the `<in/>` cell, and that the desired strings and
numbers have been placed into the `<out/>` cell.

Cells holding semantic lists can be connected to the standard input and
standard output buffers, and `krun` knows how to handle these appropriately.
Let us connect the `<in/>` cell to the standard input using the cell attribute
`stream="stdin"` and the `<out/>` cell to the standard output with the
attribute `stream="sdtout"`. A cell connected to the standard input will
take its items from the standard input and block the rewriting process when
an input is needed until an item is available in the standard input buffer.
A cell connected to the standard output buffer will send all its items, in
order, to the standard output.

Let us `kompile` and `krun` `io.imp` again. It prints the message and then
waits for your input numbers. Type in two numbers, then press `<Enter>`.
A message with their sum is then printed, followed by the final configuration.
If you do not want to see the final configuration, and thus obtain a realistic
interpreter for our language, then call `krun` with the option `--output none`:

    krun io.imp --output none

Let us now `krun` our interactive sum program, which continuously reads numbers
from the console and prints the sum of numbers up to them:

    krun sum-io.imp

Try a few numbers, then `0`. Note that the program terminated, but with junk
in the `<k/>` cell, essentially with a `halt` statement on its top. Of course,
because `halt` has been reached and it has no semantics yet.

In the next lesson we give the semantics of `halt` and also fix the semantics
of blocks with local variable declarations.
