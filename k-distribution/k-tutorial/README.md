# K Tutorial

The purpose of this series of lessons is to teach developers how to program in
K. While the primary use of K is in the specification of operational semantics
of programming languages, this tutorial is agnostic on how the knowledge of K
is used. For a more detailed tutorial explaining the basic principles of
programming language design, refer to the
[K PL Tutorial](../pl-tutorial/README.md). Note that that tutorial is somewhat
out of date presently.

This K tutorial is a work in progress. Many lessons are currently simply
placeholders for future content.

To start the K tutorial, begin with
[Section 1: Basic Programming in K](1_basic/README.md).
