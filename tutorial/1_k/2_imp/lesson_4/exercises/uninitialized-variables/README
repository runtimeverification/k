Modify the K definition of IMP to not automatically initialize
variables to 0.  Instead, declared variables should stay uninitialized
until assigned a value, and the execution should get stuck when an
uninitialized variable is looked up.  Specifically, you should add a
new "undefined" construct of sort K, and initialize all the declared
variables with it.
