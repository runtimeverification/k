# Learning K

We start by introducing the basic features of K by means of a series
of very simple languages.  The objective here is neither to learn those
languages nor to study their underlying paradigm, but simply to learn K.

-   [LAMBDA](1_lambda/README.md): Lambda calculus defined.
-   [IMP](2_IMP/README.md): A simple imperative language.
-   [LAMBDA++](3_lambda++/README.md): LAMBDA extended with control flow.
-   [IMP++](4_imp++/README.md): IMP extended with threads and IO.
-   [TYPES](5_types/README.md): LAMBDA type system.
