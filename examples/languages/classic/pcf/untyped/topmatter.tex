\title{PCF --- Dynamic}

\section*{Abstract}
This is the \K semantic definition of Programming Computable Functions, or PCF for short. PCF is a programming language for computable functions, introduced by Plotkin in 1977. It is based on Scott's logic of computable functions.

This definition specifically captures the dynamic semantics of call-by-value PCF.  The dynamic semantics does not include types---the static type system for PCF can be defined separately. A call-by-name variant of PCF can easily be obtained by making two slight modifications to the definition, as noted below.

Although calculi such as PCF typically have substitution-based definitions, the definition that follows is environment-based due to the simplicity of working with environments in \K.

This \K definition is authored and maintained by David Lazar (\href{mailto:lazar6@illinois.edu}{lazar6@illinois.edu}).
