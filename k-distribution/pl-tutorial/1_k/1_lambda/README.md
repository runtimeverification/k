## Part 1: Defining LAMBDA

Here you will learn how to define a very simple language in K and the basics
of how to use the K tool.  The language is a variant of call-by-value lambda
calculus and its definition is based on substitution.  Specifically, you will
learn the following:

* How to define a module.
* How to define a language syntax.
* How to use the defined syntax to parse programs.
* How to import predefined modules.
* How to define evaluation strategies using strictness attributes.
* How to define semantic rules.
* How the predefined generic substitution works.
* How to generate PDF and HTML documentation from ASCII definitions.
* How to include builtins (integers and Booleans) into your language.
* How to define derived language constructs.

This folder contains several lessons, each adding new features to LAMBDA.
