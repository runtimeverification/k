# K Languages

Here we present several "real-world" language examples. These languages
demonstrate many of the features you would expect to find in a full-fledged
programming language.

-   SIMPLE: Imperative programming language with threads.
-   KOOL: SIMPLE extended with object-oriented features.
-   FUN: A functional language with algebraic data-types and pattern-matching.
-   LOGIK: A logical programming language based on clause unification.
