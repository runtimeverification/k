# Completing and Documenting IMP

We here learn no new concepts, but it is a good moment to take a break
and contemplate what we learned so far.

Let us add lots of formal annotations to `imp.k`.

Once we are done with the annotations, we kompile with the documentation
option and then take a look at the produced document. We often call these
documents _language posters_. Depending on how much information you add to
these language posters, they can serve as standalone, formal presentations
of your languages. For example, you can print them as large posters and
post them on the wall, or in poster sessions at conferences.

This completes our second tutorial. The next tutorials will teach us more
features of the K framework, such as how to define languages with complex
control constructs (like `callcc`), languages which are concurrent, and so on.
