# Part 3: Defining LAMBDA++

Here you will learn how to define language constructs which abruptly change
the execution control flow, and how to define language semantics following
and environment/store style.  Specifically, you will learn the following:

* How to define constructs like `callcc`, which allow you to take snapshots of
  program executions and to go *back in time* at any moment.
* How to define languages in an environment/store style.
* Some basic notions about the use of closures and closure-like semantic
  structures to save and restore execution environments.
* Some basic intuitions about reusing existing semantics in new languages,
  as well as some of the pitfalls in doing so.
