For installation instructions, please see the INSTALL file. 

The languages defined so far using the K framework can be found in the 
examples directory. For example, the directory examples/simple contains 
2 directories, untyped containing the definition of the untyped version 
of the language, and typed which in turn contains three directories with 
definitions: static , for the static semantics, i.e., the type checker, 
dynamic , for the dynamically typed version of simple, and 
dynamic-typed-locations which is a variant of dynamic , in which the 
type information is maintained in the environment. 

Please update regularly using `svn up' from the base directory to 
benefit of the latest fixes and features. 

When writing new definitions: all definitions should load the 
k-prelude.maude file, and the semantics should include the K module. The 
name of the main module of a definition should be the capitalized 
version of the name of the file containing it. 

When adding new rules to a definition, keep in mind the following 
important restrictions: (1) never define two operations with the same 
name (but different arities), and (2) any operation should be applied on 
terms of sorts lower than those declared in the arity (that is, no 
subterm appearing in the definition should parse to a kind; if desired, 
overload the operations to extend their range). 

To compile a definition: execute the kompile.pl script passing as 
parameter the name of the file containing the main module. If the 
compilation succeeds, the output would be placed in 
name-of-the-file-compiled.maude . Currently, the script only runs under 
Unix. 

Recommendations on running the script:
- The Maude executable should be on the path and MAUDE_LIB should point
to the location where prelude.maude resides
- the script should be run from the directory where the definition 
resides, e.g., by providing the relative path to the script. The 
scripts should not be moved from the tools directory.

Example of usage: from the examples/simple/untyped directory run 
the script as:
  MAUDE_LIB=<maudeDir> ../../../tools/kompile.pl simple-untyped.maude
where <maudeDir> should be replaced by the path where prelude.maude 
reside Alternatively, you could set MAUDE_LIB in your .bash_profile 
and add the tools directory to the path, and run the script as:
  kompile.pl simple-untyped.maude

Test cases:
When filing a bug, it is important to add an automated test case that 
exhibits the bug. This allows us to test our fixes and helps catch 
regressions in the future. We use a simple Makefile based test system 
that is set up in the following way. If you use our example Makefile 
(provided in the example directory and described below) it should be 
very easy to add a new test to the system. Just copy and edit. Detailed 
descriptions follow. 



Test cases for new bugs should be placed in /trunk/newTests in the 
following manner:
$ cd trunk/newTests
$ svn cp example issueXXX
This copies the example test to a new directory so you can edit it.
XXX is intended to be the # of the issue you post on google code.

Now, edit the files in the issueXXX directory to reflect your bug.
You must keep the Makefile, which you can adjust to suit the filenames you use.  In your test.m file, writing
rew test1(.List{K}) . ---@ foo 'SomeLabel(.List{K})
causes the test to reduce "test1(.List{K})" and ensures that the result
contains the substring "'SomeLabel(.List{K})", in addition to naming the test "foo".
It's parsed like this:
[rew|red|etc] [testString] . ---@ [testNameWithNoSpaces] [resultString]

Writing:
rew test1(.List{K}) .
simply checks that it reduces at all.  It's not a very strong test.

Your test is in the correct form is you can type "make true-test" 
and an .xml file is created.
$ cd trunk/newTests/issueXXX
$ make true-test
$ cat *.xml
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8' ?>
<testsuite name='issuexxx.test' time='0'>
        <testcase name='test1' time='0'>
                <failure>Failure</failure>
        </testcase>
        <testcase name='test2' time='0'>
                Success
        </testcase>
</testsuite>

Since you are adding this test because you have a bug, at least one of
your individual tests should give a failure message.
