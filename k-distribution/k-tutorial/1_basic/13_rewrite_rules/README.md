# Lesson 1.13: Basics of K Rewriting

The purpose of this lesson is to explain how rewrite rules which are not the
definition of a function behave, and how, using these rules, you can construct
a semantics of programs in a programming language in K.

## Recap: Function rules in K

Recall from [Lesson 1.2](../02_basics/README.md) that we have, thus far,
introduced two types of productions in K: **constructors** and **functions**.
A function is identified by the **function** attribute placed on the
production. As you may recall, when we write a rule with a function on the
left-hand side of the `=>` operator, we are defining the meaning of that
function for inputs which match the patterns on the left-hand side of the rule.
If the argument to the function match the patterns, then the function is
evaluated to the value constructed by substituting the bindings for the
variables into the right-hand side of the rule.

## Top-level rules

However, function rules are not the only type of rule permissible in K, nor
even the most frequently used. K also has a concept of a
**top-level rewrite rule**. The simplest way to ensure that a rule is treated
as a top-level rule is for the left-hand side of the rule to mention one or
more **cells**. We will cover how cells work and are declared in more detail
in a later lesson, but for now, what you should know is that when we ran `krun`
in our very first example in Lesson 1.2 and got the following output:

```
<k>
  Yellow ( ) ~> .
</k>
```

`<k>` is a cell, known by convention as the **K cell**. This cell is available
by default in any definition without needing to be explicitly declared.

The K cell contains a single term of sort `K`. `K` is a predefined sort in K
with two constructors, that can be roughly represented by the following
grammar:

```
  syntax K ::= KItem "~>" K
             | "."
```

As a syntactic convenience, K allows you to treat `~>` like it is an
associative list (i.e., as if it were defined as `syntax K ::= K "~>" K`), but
when a definition is compiled, it will automatically transform the rules you
write so that they treat the `K` sort as a cons-list. Another syntactic
convenience is that, for disambiguation purposes, you can write `.K` anywhere
you would otherwise write `.` and the meaning is identical.

Now, you may notice that the above grammar mentions the sort `KItem`. This is
another built-in sort in K. For every sort `S` declared in a definition (with
the exception of `K` and `KItem`), K will implicitly insert the following
production: 

```
  syntax KItem ::= S
```

In other words, every sort is a subsort of the sort `KItem`, and thus a term
of any sort can be injected as an element of a term of sort `K`, also called
a **K sequence**.

By default, when you `krun` a program, the AST of the program is inserted as
the sole element of a K sequence into the `<k>` cell. This explains why we
saw the output we did in Lesson 1.2.

With these preliminaries in mind, we can now explain how top-level rewrite
rules work in K. Put simply, any rule where there is a cell (such as the K
cell) at the top on the left-hand side will be a top-level rewrite rule. Once
the initial program has been inserted into the K cell, the resulting term,
called the **configuration**, will be matched against all the top-level
rewrite rules in the definition. If only one rule matches, the substitution
generated by the matching will be applied to the right-hand side of the rule
and the resulting term is **rewritten** to be the new configuration. Rewriting
proceeds by iteratively applying rules, also called **taking steps**, until
no top-level rewrite rule can be applied. At this point the configuration
becomes the **final configuration** and is output by `krun`.

If more than one top-level rule applies, by default, `K` will pick just one
of those rules, apply it, and continue rewriting. However, it is
**non-deterministic** which rule applies. In theory, it could be any of them.
By passing the `--search` flag to `krun`, you are able to tell `krun` to 
explore all possible non-deterministic choices, and generate a complete list of
all possible final configurations reachable by each nondeterminstic choice that
can be made. Note that the `--search` flag to krun only functions if you pass
`--enable-search` to kompile first.

### Exercise

Pass a program containing no functions to `krun`. You can use a term of sort
`Exp` from `LESSON-11-D`. Observe the output and try to understand why you get
the output you do. Then write two rules that rewrite that program to another.
Run `krun --search` on that program and observe both results. Then add a third
rule that rewrites one of those results again. Test that that rule applies as
well.

## Using top-level rules to evaluate expressions

Thus far, we have focused primarily on defining functions over constructors
in K. However, now that we have a basic understanding of top-level rules,
it is possible to introduce a **rewrite system** to our definitions. A rewrite
system is a collection of top-level rewrite rules which performs an organized
transformation of a particular program into a result which expresses the
meaning of that program. For example, we might rewrite an expression in a
programming language into a value representing the result of evaluating that
expression.

Recall in Lesson 1.11, we wrote a simple grammar of Boolean and integer
expressions that looked roughly like this (`lesson-13-a.k`):

```k
module LESSON-13-A
  imports INT

  syntax Exp ::= Int
               | Bool
               | Exp "+" Exp
               | Exp "&&" Exp
endmodule
```

In that lesson, we defined a function `eval` which evaluated such expressions
to either an integer or Boolean.

However, it is more idiomatic to evaluate such expressions using top-level
rewrite rules. Here is how one might do so in K (`lesson-13-b.k`):

```k
module LESSON-13-B-SYNTAX
  imports UNSIGNED-INT-SYNTAX
  imports BOOL-SYNTAX

  syntax Val ::= Int | Bool
  syntax Exp ::= Val
               > left: Exp "+" Exp
               > left: Exp "&&" Exp
endmodule

module LESSON-13-B
  imports LESSON-13-B-SYNTAX
  imports INT
  imports BOOL

  rule <k> I1:Int + I2:Int ~> K:K </k> => <k> I1 +Int I2 ~> K </k>
  rule <k> B1:Bool && B2:Bool ~> K:K </k> => <k> B1 andBool B2 ~> K </k>

  syntax KItem ::= freezer1(Val) | freezer2(Exp)
                 | freezer3(Val) | freezer4(Exp)

  rule <k> E1:Val + E2:Exp ~> K:K </k> => <k> E2 ~> freezer1(E1) ~> K </k> [priority(51)]
  rule <k> E1:Exp + E2:Exp ~> K:K </k> => <k> E1 ~> freezer2(E2) ~> K </k> [priority(52)]
  rule <k> E1:Val && E2:Exp ~> K:K </k> => <k> E2 ~> freezer3(E1) ~> K </k> [priority(51)]
  rule <k> E1:Exp && E2:Exp ~> K:K </k> => <k> E1 ~> freezer4(E2) ~> K </k> [priority(52)]

  rule <k> E2:Val ~> freezer1(E1) ~> K:K </k> => <k> E1 + E2 ~> K </k>
  rule <k> E1:Val ~> freezer2(E2) ~> K:K </k> => <k> E1 + E2 ~> K </k>
  rule <k> E2:Val ~> freezer3(E1) ~> K:K </k> => <k> E1 && E2 ~> K </k>
  rule <k> E1:Val ~> freezer4(E2) ~> K:K </k> => <k> E1 && E2 ~> K </k>
endmodule
```

This is of course rather cumbersome currently, but we will soon introduce
syntactic convenience which makes writing definitions of this type considerably
easier. For now, notice that there are roughly 3 types of rules here: the first
matches a K cell in which the first element of the K sequence is an `Exp` whose
arguments are values, and rewrites the first element of the sequence to the
result of that expression. The second also matches a K cell with an `Exp` in
the first element of its K sequence, but it matches when one or both arguments
of the `Exp` are not values, and replace the first element of the K sequence
with two new elements: one being an argument to evaluate, and the other being
a special constructor called a **freezer**. Finally, the third matches a K
sequence where a `Val` is first, and a freezer is second, and replaces them
with a partially evaluated expression.

This general pattern is what is known as **heating** an expression,
**evaluating** its arguments, **cooling** the arguments into the expression
again, and **evaluating** the expression itself. By repeatedly performing
this sequence of actions, we can evaluate an entire AST containing a complex
expression down into its resulting value.

### Exercise

Write an addition expression with integers. Use `krun --depth 1` to see the
result of rewriting after applying a single top-level rule. Gradually increase
the value of `--depth` to see successive states. Observe how this combination
of rules is eventually able to evaluate the entire expression.

## Simplifying the evaluator: Local rewrites and cell ellipses

As you saw above, the definition we wrote is rather cumbersome. Over the
remainder of Lessons 1.13 and 1.14, we will greatly simplify it. The first step
in doing so is to teach a bit more about the rewrite operator, `=>`. Thus far,
all the rules we have written look like `rule LHS => RHS`. However, this is not
the only way the rewrite operator can be used. It is actually possible to place
a constructor or function at the very top of the rule, and place rewrite
operators inside that term. While a rewrite operator cannot appear nested
inside another rewrite operator, by doing this, we can express that some parts
of what we are matching are not **changed** by the rewrite operator. For
example, consider the following rule from above:

```
  rule <k> I1:Int + I2:Int ~> K:K </k> => <k> I1 +Int I2 ~> K </k>
```

We can equivalently write it like following:

```
  rule <k> (I1:Int + I2:Int => I1 +Int I2) ~> _:K </k>
```

When you put a rewrite inside a term like this, in essence, you are telling
the rule to only rewrite **part** of the left-hand side to the right-hand side.
In practice, this is implemented by lifting the rewrite operator to the top of
the rule by means of duplicating the surrounding context.

There is a way that the above rule can be simplified further, however. K
provides a special syntax for each cell containing a term of sort K, indicating
that we want to match only on some prefix of the K sequence. For example, the
above rule can be simplified further like so:

```
  rule <k> I1:Int + I2:Int => I1 +Int I2 ...</k>
```

Here we have placed the symbol `...` immediately prior to the `</k>` which ends
 the cell. What this tells the compiler is to take the contents of the cell,
treat it as the prefix of a K sequence, and insert an anonymous variable of
sort `K` at the end. Thus we can think of `...` as a way of saying we
**don't care** about the part of the K sequence after the beginning, leaving
it unchanged.

Putting all this together, we can rewrite `LESSON-13-B` like so
(`lesson-13-c.k`):

```k
module LESSON-13-C-SYNTAX
  imports UNSIGNED-INT-SYNTAX
  imports BOOL-SYNTAX

  syntax Val ::= Int | Bool
  syntax Exp ::= Val
               > left: Exp "+" Exp
               > left: Exp "&&" Exp
endmodule

module LESSON-13-C
  imports LESSON-13-C-SYNTAX
  imports INT
  imports BOOL

  rule <k> I1:Int + I2:Int => I1 +Int I2 ...</k>
  rule <k> B1:Bool && B2:Bool => B1 andBool B2 ...</k>

  syntax KItem ::= freezer1(Val) | freezer2(Exp)
                 | freezer3(Val) | freezer4(Exp)

  rule <k> E1:Val + E2:Exp => E2 ~> freezer1(E1) ...</k> [priority(51)]
  rule <k> E1:Exp + E2:Exp => E1 ~> freezer2(E2) ...</k> [priority(52)]
  rule <k> E1:Val && E2:Exp => E2 ~> freezer3(E1) ...</k> [priority(51)]
  rule <k> E1:Exp && E2:Exp => E1 ~> freezer4(E2) ...</k> [priority(52)]

  rule <k> E2:Val ~> freezer1(E1) => E1 + E2 ...</k>
  rule <k> E1:Val ~> freezer2(E2) => E1 + E2 ...</k>
  rule <k> E2:Val ~> freezer3(E1) => E1 && E2 ...</k>
  rule <k> E1:Val ~> freezer4(E2) => E1 && E2 ...</k>
endmodule
```

This is still rather cumbersome, but it is already greatly simplified. In the
next lesson, we will see how additional features of K can be used to specify
heating and cooling rules much more compactly.
