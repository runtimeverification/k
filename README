1. This is a readme file for the developers.

2. Install
checkout this directory in your desired location and update your $PATH to /dist/bin directory so you can test.  Then build the .jar binaries by calling ant on /javasources/K3Java/buld.xml.

3. Work on java code
Open eclipse with the spoofax plug-in installed and set your workspace to /javasources.
Go to File->Import->General->Existing projects into workspace, and select all of the projects from /javasources.
You can run the K3Java project to test the main functionalities directly from eclipse (main project is K3Java), or you can (re)build the .jar binaries by calling ant on /javasources/K3Java/buld.xml

4. Work on maude code
Modify the maude files found in /dist/bin/maude

5. Build the final release zip
Call ant on /buildrelease.xml - not yet implemented (anyone?)
Or you can just zip the /dist folder after you have built the /javasources.


6. Compiling definitions and running programs
assuming  /dist/bin is in your path, you can compile definitions using the 'kompile' command.  Until jKrun is released, to execute a  program you can use the Haskell krun specifying it should use the kast from /dist/bin as a parser.  Assuming $K3_BASE points to the /dist directory, the following command should suffice:
krun --parser="$K3_BASE/bin/kast" <program>
