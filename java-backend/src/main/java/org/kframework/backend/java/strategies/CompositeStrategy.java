/**
 * A CompositeStrategy is used to combine multiple to strategies together in
 * a stack. Strategies can be pushed and popped onto the composite strategy.
 * When resetting a composite strategy the rules are passed to the bottom of
 * the stack. Once the bottom strategy has partitioned the rules, it's next()
 * class of rules is passed to the strategy above it to be partitioned. This
 * propogates to the top of the stack, until the top strategy receives a set
 * of rules to partition.
 *
 * For example: If we have a transition strategy on top of a priority strategy,
 * we will first get the highest priority rules from the priority strategy, then
 * partition them with the transition strategy. If instead, the priority
 * strategy is on top, then we will first get the structural rules from the
 * transition strategy, then partition them with the priority strategy.
 *
 * When getting the next equivalence class from a composite strategy, we first
 * attempt to get it from the top strategy. If it does not have a next class
 * we pop it from the stack, and retry with the next strategy. Once we get a
 * next class of rules we pass it in through the strategies again, as we add
 * them back to the stack until we eventually get back to the top of the stack.
