K Tutorial --- LAMBDA --- Derived Constructs
by Grigore Rosu

When defining a language, we often want certain language constructs to be
defined in terms of other constructs.  For example, a let-binding construct
of the form

  let x = e in e'

is nothing but syntactic sugar for

  (lambda x . e') e

This can be easily achieved with a rule, as shown in lambda.k.

As a side point, which is not very relevant here, we may want the "desugaring"
of let to not even count as a computational step, but as a mere "structural
rearangement" of the program so that other semantics rules (beta reduction,
in our case) can match and apply.

The K tool allows us to tag rules with the attribute "structural", with
precisely the intuition above.  You can think of structural rules as a kind
of light rules, almost like macros, or like ones which apply "under the hood",
instanteneously.  There are several other uses for structural rules in K.

Compile lambda.k and write some programs using let binders.

In the next lecture we will define the conditional construct, which together
with the let binder will allow us to write interesting programs.
