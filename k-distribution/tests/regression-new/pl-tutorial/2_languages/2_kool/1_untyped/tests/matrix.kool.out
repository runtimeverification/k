Input the number of lines and columns (two natural numbers): Line 1 (3 elements): Line 2 (3 elements): Your matrix is:
Line 1 (3 elements): 1 2 3
Line 2 (3 elements): 4 5 6
Here is a copy of your matrix:
Line 1 (3 elements): 1 2 3
Line 2 (3 elements): 4 5 6
The transpose of your matrix is:
Line 1 (2 elements): 1 4
Line 2 (2 elements): 2 5
Line 3 (2 elements): 3 6
You matrix multiplied with its transpose is:
Line 1 (2 elements): 14 32
Line 2 (2 elements): 32 77
The transpose of your matrix multiplied with your matrix is:
Line 1 (3 elements): 17 22 27
Line 2 (3 elements): 22 29 36
Line 3 (3 elements): 27 36 45
Done.
