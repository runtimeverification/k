// This program shows an interesting situation which can happen in many
// language designs: something which looks correct is actually wrong:

int x;

void main() {
  int n = 5;
  x = 1;
  for (int i=1; i<=n; ++i) {
    int t=i;
    spawn {
      multX(t);
    };
  }
  for (int i=1; i<=n; ++i) {
    rendezvous i;
  }
  print(x,"\n");
}

void multX(int v) {
  acquire 0;
  x = x*v;
  release 0;
  rendezvous v;
}

// 120, but also many many other behaviors ...

// The problem is that "spawn multX(i);" does not evaluate the "i" argument,
// it only spawns a thread calculating the expression statement "multX(i);".
// It can be possible that the loop counter "i" is incremented right after the
// spawning but before the evaluation of the expression "multX(i)".  In fact,
// it can be the case that all the spawned "multX(i);" statements will evaluate
// their "multX(i)" function calls after the main loop terminates.  The threads
// will still see the "i" counter in their environments, but that will hold
// the value 6.  Thus, in this case, all threads compute "multX(6)"!  You can
// see all these "unexpected" behaviors if you use the search option in krun.
// (please make n smaller, e.g. 2, because theare are LOTS of behaviors here!)
//
// To fix this problem , replace loop "for(i=1;i<=n;++i) {spawn {multX(i);};}"
// with "for(i=1;i<=n;++i) {var t=i; spawn {multX(t);};}".  Now, each thread
// sees its own local "t", which has the right value and does not change.
// Now the search option in krun only shows you solutions which output the
// correct factorial.  (like before, please make n smaller (2?) when running
// the search option in krun, because theare are LOTS of behaviors here!)
