\section{Abstract}
This is the \K semantic definition of the classic EXP language.
The EXP language was originally proposed by Robin Milner in his
seminal paper on type inference below:
\begin{quote}
Robin Milner. A theory of type polymorphism in programming.
{\em Journal of Computer and System Sciences}, 17(3):348-375, 1978.
\end{quote}
EXP captures the essence of functional languages, providing basic
artihmetic expression constructs, $\lambda$ and $\mu$ abstractions,
function application, a conditional, and (derived) \texttt{let} and
\texttt{letrec} binders.
